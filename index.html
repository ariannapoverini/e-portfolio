            <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
            <p>This module focused on the principles of object-oriented programming in Python. We learned about classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. The module also covered data structures and algorithms, including their implementation in Python. UML diagrams were used to model the design of the programs.</p>

            <h2>Reflection on Object-Oriented Programming</h2>

            <p>This reflection utilises the Four F's (Facts, Feelings, Findings, Future) framework to critically evaluate the learning experience of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. As a junior frontend engineer primarily experienced with JavaScript and having only brief prior exposure to Python, this module, grounded in Allen B. Downey's "Think Python" and involving a project on designing robot-human interaction, offered a structured immersion into OOP principles such as Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism: interacting objects on which the structure of OOP programs is based, promoting modularity, reusability, and easier maintenance by breaking down complexity into manageable, encapsulated parts.</p>
            <h4>Facts</h4>
            <p>The module systematically introduced fundamental OOP concepts using Python. Key topics such as class definition, object instantiation, attributes, and methods were all put to the test through the system design of initial implementation of a project aimed at supporting robot-human interaction. 
                For the project of a warehouse robot, the system architecture was designed using OOP principles involving classes such as WarehouseRobot, PackingSystem, StockSystem, and others - each containing specific variables - managing their states and interactions effectively.</p>
            <p>The project exhibits dynamic behaviour through interactions, Unified Modelling Language (UML) provides Interaction Diagrams specifically to visualise and analyse them.These diagrams are crucial for understanding system behaviour, debugging interactions, validating designs against requirements, and communicating the dynamic flow that a system like the Warehouse Robot uses.</p>
            <p>To ensure a system behaves as expected we employ techniques such as debugging (finding and fixing errors), error handling (managing runtime issues) and testing (systematic verification of the software functioning as expected). These techniques are critical for creating reliable software and therefore foundational to professional software development.</p>

            <h4>Feelings</h4>
            <p>Engaging deeply with Python's approach to OOP felt like exploring familiar territory (object concepts) through a new lens. Having primarily worked with JavaScript objects, prototypes, and ES6 classes in a frontend context, Python's structure felt notably explicit and, in some ways, more formally defined. </p>
            <p>Python’s connections to JavaScript were evident. Python's class syntax offered a conceptual parallel to JavaScript's ES6 class, although the underlying difference between Python's class-based inheritance and JavaScript's prototypal inheritance was an important difference. The explicit nature of Python's self was different to the more context-dependent behaviour of JavaScript's this keyword. Python's clear separation of mutable (list) and immutable (tuple) sequence types also provided a different perspective compared to JavaScript arrays. Both languages clearly support multiple paradigms, including object-oriented and functional approaches.</p>
            <p>The required self parameter, while initially feeling unnecessary compared to JavaScript's implicit this, quickly became appreciated for its clarity, removing the ambiguity often encountered with this binding in JavaScript callbacks or different execution contexts.</p>
            <p>While comfortable manipulating objects and using classes in JavaScript for UI components or state management, the formal OOP structure presented in "Think Python" felt more rigorous, although there was an appreciation for Python's syntactic clarity. Concepts like class-based inheritance felt more straightforward compared to navigating JavaScript's prototype chain, especially having only briefly encountered Python before. Designing the robot-human interaction project using these principles was challenging but ultimately rewarding, as the OOP structure helped organise the complexity. Debugging interactions, however, sometimes felt frustrating, echoing similar challenges in complex JavaScript applications but perhaps highlighting Python's stricter error handling (e.g., TypeErrors).</p>

            <h4>Findings</h4>
            <p>The most significant finding was a reinforced understanding of OOP's power in managing complexity for building robust, maintainable software – a principle highly relevant to frontend architecture, demonstrated clearly through the robot-human interaction project. The module provided an excellent, accessible pathway into these structured concepts.
                Python's emphasis on explicit self and its relatively stricter typing encourages a discipline that can be beneficially applied back to frontend software development, promoting more predictable state management and interaction logic. While JavaScript offers immense flexibility (often needed for dynamic UIs), Python's more structured approach to OOP provided a solid conceptual foundation that might be less explicitly taught in typical frontend onboarding.
                Learning formal OOP through Python provided a valuable framework to critically assess JavaScript practices. It encouraged moving beyond simply using objects or basic classes towards intentionally designing with OOP principles like encapsulation and clear inheritance/composition patterns, even within a primarily JavaScript role.</p>

            <h4>Future</h4>
            <p>The structured understanding of OOP gained from this module will directly influence my professional approach as I intend to apply principles of clear encapsulation, well-defined interfaces, and thoughtful use of classes (or functional alternatives where appropriate) when building JavaScript components and managing application state, aiming for greater modularity and testability. Understanding Python's explicit self reinforces the need for careful testing and management of this in JavaScript.</p>
            <p>This experience motivates exploring formal design patterns (Strategy, Observer, etc.) more deeply and applying them within frontend frameworks. The principles practiced in the robot-human interaction project – designing clear class hierarchies and managing object interactions – are directly applicable to designing complex UI components and state management logic. This cross-language perspective, rooted in a solid OOP foundation gained via Python, enhances my ability to architect robust and maintainable applications, contributing positively to my professional growth.</p>
